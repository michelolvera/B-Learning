# Minibool

This project is a didactic software that allows to read boolean expressions in different formats (truth tables, Karnaugh maps, Boolean functions expressed in mini-terms, maxi-terms or non-standard Boolean expressions), simplifies these expressions, contributing to improve performance of the students who take careers in the area of computing in various institutions.

Developed for the Instituto Tecnológico de Morelia, as a research project approved by the Tecnológico Nacional de México.
